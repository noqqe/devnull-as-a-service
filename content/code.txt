# /dev/null as a Service

Your developers will love our simple and well documented API. 
Just do a HTTP POST request to our shiny REST-API, and we will take care of its deletion with
our Heavily Distributed BigData Cloud Cluster Setup!

    $ curl -d @invoice.pdf -X POST http://devnull-as-a-service.com/dev/null 
    
If you are interested in some more informations about the ongoing deletion, use:

    $ curl -v -d @photos-of-yourself.zip -X POST http://devnull-as-a-service.com/dev/null 

If you're a `wget` Windows multiplatform lover, you could use:

    $ wget -O- -v --post-file=backups.tar.gz http://devnull-as-a-service.com/dev/null

# Self Hosted Enterprise Appliance!

For only $5,000 per year, you get your own, self-hosted enterprise appliance.
Okay, let's be honest, it's basically a crappy Pentium 4 box with [Debian](http://debian.org) 
and [nginx](http://nginx.org) installed. 

The configuration looks pretty much like:

    location /dev/null {
        if ($request_method = POST ) {
          return 200;
        }
        if ($request_method = GET ) {
          return 404;
        }
    }

But we think your data is worth it.
