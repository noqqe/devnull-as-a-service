# Whats up? 

So, we heard you're a random sales guy without any technical knowledge? Let's quote 
Wikipedia:

> In Unix-like operating systems, /dev/null or the null device is a special file
> that discards all data written to it but reports that the write operation 
> succeeded. It provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding 
> EOF immediately.
