### What's up?

So, we heard you're a random sales guy without any technical knowledge? Let's quote
Wikipedia:

> In Unix-like operating systems, /dev/null or the null device is a special file
> that discards all data written to it but reports that the write operation
> succeeded. It provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding
> EOF immediately.

### Privacy

We know that everyone cares about their privacy these days.  We care about your
privacy concerns, and guarantee all of your data will be completely
discarded[1].

[1] Except for cases where it will be stored indefinitely to ensure compliance
with *government* regulations[2].

[2] When we say 'government' we mean NSA, CIA, FBI, TSA, Communist Party of
China (CPC), Village Roadshow Pictures, Sony, the FSB, some of your coworkers and
our friends (especially if there is something funny).
