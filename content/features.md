### What's up?

So, we heard you're a random sales guy without any technical knowledge? Let's quote
Wikipedia:

> In Unix-like operating systems, /dev/null or the null device is a special file
> that discards all data written to it but reports that the write operation
> succeeded. It provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding
> EOF immediately.

Not only is everything becoming a service on the internet, it is becoming 'containerized.' That's why we're

### Privacy

We know that everyone cares about their privacy these days.  We care about your
privacy concerns, and guarantee all of your data will be completely
discarded[1].

[1] Except for cases where it will be stored indefinitely to ensure compliance
with *government* regulations[2].

[2] When we say 'government' we mean NSA, CIA, FBI, TSA, Communist Party of
China (CPC), Nestle, The Coca-Cola Company, the FSB, some of your coworkers and
our friends (especially if there is something funny).
