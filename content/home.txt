In modern days everything is a service. You create
[documents](http://docs.google.com), upload [photos](http://instagram.com), 
deploy [computers](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), but what's happening
to your trash? That's why we're launching /dev/null to the cloud.

[IAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29), 
[SAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Software_as_a_service_.28SaaS.29),
[PAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Platform_as_a_service_.28PaaS.29), holy fuckshit, we call our baby DAAS.

Don't get rid of your data yourself anymore. Use our distributed service 
located in over 380 countries! No matter if you're using it personally or for your business:
plans for whole companies are available as well.

Just because, of course, everything should be a managed-service somewhere in the internet!

# Who we are

<center><img src="/img/shirt.png" /></center>

We're a young and dynamic team of messy data-scientists who have failed at being employed
on the real market. Our experience in losing data and throwing files
away is more than amazing! Over the years, we have managed to get rid of so much important data
at home and even at work. Pictures of our holidays, important invoices, login details... 
it's all gone. So we started to make a business out of what we're good at. 

# News

* Now with [Discard protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discard_Protocol) support! See [Code](/code) for details.
* Corporate identity. We're now having some shirts!
